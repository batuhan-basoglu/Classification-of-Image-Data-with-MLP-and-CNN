# Classification-of-Image-Data-with-MLP-and-CNN

This project implements both a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional neural network in Python; 
the perceptron comprises an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, 
while the convolutional network features two convolutional layers, a fully connected hidden layer
and a fully connected output layer.
